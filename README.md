Blazingly fast, modular and contributor friendly Solidity compiler, written in Rust.

## Features and Goals

- Instant compiles and low memory usage
- Expressive and useful diagnostics
- Modular, library based architecture
- Simple and hackable code base
- Compatibility with the latest Solidity language breaking version (0.8.*)

## Roadmap

You can find a more detailed roadmap in the [pinned GitHub issue](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/solar/issues/1).

- [ ] Front-end
  - [x] Lexing
  - [x] Parsing
  - [ ] Semantic analysis
    - [x] Symbol resolution 
    - [ ] Type checker
    - [ ] Static analysis
- [ ] Middle-end
- [ ] Back-end

## Getting started

Solar is available through a command-line interface, or as a Rust library.

### Library usage

You can add Solar to your Rust project by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
solar = { version = "0.1.0", package = "solar-compiler" }
```

Or through the CLI:

```console
$ cargo add solar-compiler --rename solar
```

You can see examples of how to use Solar as a library in the [examples](/examples) directory.

### Binary usage

Pre-built binaries are available for macOS, Linux and Windows on the [releases page](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/solar/releases)
and can be installed with the following commands:

```console
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://ithaca.xyz/solar/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -c "irm https://ithaca.xyz/solar/install.ps1 | iex"

# For a specific version.
curl -LsSf https://ithaca.xyz/solar/0.1.0/install.sh | sh
powershell -c "irm https://ithaca.xyz/solar/0.1.0/install.ps1 | iex"
```

You can also build Solar from source:

```console
# From crates.io.
$ cargo install solar-compiler --locked

# From GitHub.
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/ithacaxyz/solar --locked

# From a Git checkout.
$ git clone https://github.com/ithacaxyz/solar
$ cd solar
$ cargo install --locked --path crates/solar
```

Once installed, check out the available options:

```console
$ solar -h
```

Here's a few examples:

```console
# Compile a single file and emit ABI to stdout.
$ solar Counter.sol --emit abi

# Compile a contract through standard input (`-` file).
$ echo "contract C {}" | solar -
$ solar - <<EOF
contract HelloWorld {
    function helloWorld() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
EOF

# Compile a file with a Foundry project's remappings.
$ solar $(forge re) src/Contract.sol
```

## Semver Compatibility

Solar's versioning tracks compatibility for the binaries, not the API.
If using this as a library, be sure to pin the version with a `=` version requirement operator.

## Supported Rust Versions (MSRV)

Solar always aims to stay up-to-date with the latest stable Rust release.

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) may be updated at any time, so we can take advantage of new features and improvements in Rust.
